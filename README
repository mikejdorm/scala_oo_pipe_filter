HW2 Deliverable

Building and Running
The code can be compiled and run with the following instructions using Scala version 2.9.x.

cd to the cspp51050 directory with the source files and execute:
	scalac *.scala

After compilation in the same directory as the source files execute the following:
	scala cspp51050.Main -classpath cspp51050

	
Design Decisions: 
My HW2 implementation of the pipe/filter architectural pattern is designed so that the flow
of data can be controlled from either side of the pipe. So the data can be pushed through
the pipe or the data can be pulled from the other side of the pipe. 

I used generics throughout the filter and pipe traits so that the data types that can be
sent through the pipe depend on the implementation. The HW2 problem required the manipulation
of strings so the pipe & filters are parameterized with the String type. 

Another important design choice was the use of the Scala Option object. By using this the 
output of the pipe will always produce some output and it eliminates the problems associated
with using null. If there is no data present in the pipe then the output of the pipe will
be the None object so a process at the end of the pipe will need to handle this situation.
