Cool, I really like your design. Here's a question, though: how standardized are
the inputs and outputs of your filters? If we were to write another filter
called "DoubleFilter" that doubled each character in the strings passed to it,
would it be as simple as adding a new pipe between your pipe and pipe2 variables
that was assigned to new Pipe(caps, double), and then, changing the next pipe's
first argument to double? I'd assume so, so long as the double filter understood
that the input type was "string," which they should be abel to rightly assume.

Nice work.
